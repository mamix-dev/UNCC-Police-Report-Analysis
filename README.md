# UNCC-Police-Report-Analysis

This project was started so that I could map out where some of the crime occurs on campus.
Currently, I'm still trying to extract data out of the pdfs and into more organized forms of data.

After extracting the data using PyPDF and putting into text, I extracted some metadata on the reports.

Wanting to get out the individual responses, I used [camelot-py](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot) to extract the tables.
I am now in the process of cleaning the data.
